How do I remove a repository from a repository?
If you have a nested repository inside your project repository:
delete its subfolder.
delete the gitlink entry (the element named after that subfolder name) git rm --cached subfolder # no trailing /
commit the deletion git commit -m "Record subfolder gitlink deletion"
git push to complete the process.
